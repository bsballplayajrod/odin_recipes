            <p>Brussels sprouts with bacon are roasted with maple syrup until crispy and caramelized for a holiday side dish that's quick and easy to make. The Brussels sprouts take on a nutty flavor during the roasting process, and the salty bacon is a delightful contrast with the sweet maple syrup.</p>
